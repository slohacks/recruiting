See the [Gatsby Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) to get started.

## Technology Stack
This project uses _React_, _GraphQL_, & _Webpack_ through _Gatsby_, _ESLint_ with Airbnb rules for linting, and _Jest_ for testing.

## Style Guides
* Javascript/JSX: [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* CSS: [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
  * There's no need for BEM in this project
  * As a rule of thumb, choose simple, descriptive names for your classes

## Commits
Use `git cz` from [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to make your commits. Commits that don't use commitizen for naming will not be accepted.

* Build: `yarn build`
* Develop: `yarn develop`
